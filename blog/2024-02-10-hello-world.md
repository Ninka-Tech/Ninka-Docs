## Hello, Ninka!

Today, I'm excited to introduce a project that I've been working on with great ambition. Meet Ninka â€“ a comprehensive authentication solution written in Go, that's both simple to set up and incredibly robust. With Ninka, you can effortlessly host your own authentication server featuring OAuth2, OIDC, and a sophisticated Group-/User-Permission system.

My goal with Ninka is to provide an exceptional experience for all users of this powerful tool. Built into the core of Ninka are features like Multi-Tenancy and Third-Party Client support, offering you the ability to easily integrate third-party applications with your resource servers through a secure OAuth2 implementation.

While Ninka is still in its early stages, I'm confident that we can make significant progress together. I invite you to join me on this journey and start using Ninka to enhance the security of your applications. I look forward to seeing you soon in the world of Ninka!
