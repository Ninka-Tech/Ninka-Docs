# Deployment

Deploying Ninka is straightforward and can be done in a few different ways.

## Deploying the Server Binary

1. **Upload the Server Binary**:

   - After building the server binary as mentioned in the setup guide, upload the binary file to your server using your preferred method.

2. **Run the Server**:
   - Once the binary is uploaded to your server, navigate to the directory where the binary is located.
   - Run the server by executing the binary file directly. For example:
     ```bash
     ./ninka-server
     ```

## Running Locally

Alternatively, you can run Ninka locally on your machine for testing or development purposes:

1. **Locate the Executable**:

   - If you've built the server binary locally, navigate to the directory where the binary is located.

2. **Run the Executable**:
   - Execute the binary file directly on your local machine. For example:
     ```bash
     ./ninka-server
     ```

## Docker (Coming Soon)

We are currently working on providing Docker support for Ninka. Stay tuned for updates on how to deploy Ninka using Docker containers.
